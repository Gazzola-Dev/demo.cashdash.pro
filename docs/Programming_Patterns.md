## Programming patterns:

This document outlines the preferred programming patterns for this repo. Any developers or LLMs working on this project should refactor code to adhere to these patterns:

### File naming:
- All files that export react components should be named in `PascalCase` - the only exceptions are files generated by Shadcn, or file-based conventions including Next.js routing files (`page.tsx` etc)
- The file path of hook, action, and type files should follow this pattern: `[type]/[table].[type].(ts/tsx)`, example: `actions/user.actions.ts` 

## Data management:
- All db interactions are performed in actions, all actions are called from the relevant action file.
- Action files have 'use server' at the top.
- `react-query` (tanstack) is used to call actions.
- `useQuery` is used to call read actions, while `useMutation` is for write actions. 
- Hook files include 'use client'at the top.
- Types are stored in `/types/` - no types should be exported from a file they are used in.
